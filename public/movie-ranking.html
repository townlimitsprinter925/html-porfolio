    50/50
</h3>
<p>
    This movie is about a 30-something who struggles dealing emotionally and socially with a diagnosis of an advanced, nonoperative cancer. It's a heavy, but relatable story of humanity.

    Definitely, maybe

    I'm a sucker for a cheesy rom-com. Ryan Gosling and the girl from <i>Little Miss Sunshine</i>, plus Isla Fisher, made for a fantastic storyline.

    007: Spectre

    I really enjoy Daniel Craig as James Bond. He's fit, suave and incredibly precise as a double-agent.
